# Instaclon functions
The API for Instaclon, works on firebase functions.

# How it works
  * `npm install` install all dependencies.
  * `npm run serve` run the project in development.
  * `npm run deploy` deploy the functions to firebase.

  > A **key.json** file is needed, it should contains all the private keys to connect to the firebase project.
